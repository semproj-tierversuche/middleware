      "Abstract" : [ "Although extensive data support a central pathogenic role for amyloid beta protein (Abeta) in Alzheimer's disease, the amyloid hypothesis remains controversial, in part because a specific neurotoxic species of Abeta and the nature of its effects on synaptic function have not been defined in vivo. Here we report that natural oligomers of human Abeta are formed soon after generation of the peptide within specific intracellular vesicles and are subsequently secreted from the cell. Cerebral microinjection of cell medium containing these oligomers and abundant Abeta monomers but no amyloid fibrils markedly inhibited hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in rats in vivo. Immunodepletion from the medium of all Abeta species completely abrogated this effect. Pretreatment of the medium with insulin-degrading enzyme, which degrades Abeta monomers but not oligomers, did not prevent the inhibition of LTP. Therefore, Abeta oligomers, in the absence of monomers and amyloid fibrils, disrupted synaptic plasticity in vivo at concentrations found in human brain and cerebrospinal fluid. Finally, treatment of cells with gamma-secretase inhibitors prevented oligomer formation at doses that allowed appreciable monomer production, and such medium no longer disrupted LTP, indicating that synaptotoxic Abeta oligomers can be targeted therapeutically." ],

            "Abstract" : [ "The presenilin containing gamma-secretase complex is responsible for the regulated intramembraneous proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), the Notch receptor, and a multitude of other substrates. gamma-Secretase catalyzes the final step in the generation of Abeta(40) and Abeta(42) peptides from APP. Amyloid beta-peptides (Abeta peptides) aggregate to form neurotoxic oligomers, senile plaques, and congophilic angiopathy, some of the cardinal pathologies associated with Alzheimer's disease. Although inhibition of this protease acting on APP may result in potentially therapeutic reductions of neurotoxic Abeta peptides, nonselective inhibition of the enzyme may cause severe adverse events as a result of impaired Notch receptor processing. Here, we report the preclinical pharmacological profile of GSI-953 (begacestat), a novel thiophene sulfonamide gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) that selectively inhibits cleavage of APP over Notch. This GSI inhibits Abeta production with low nanomolar potency in cellular and cell-free assays of gamma-secretase function, and displaces a tritiated analog of GSI-953 from enriched gamma-secretase enzyme complexes with similar potency. Cellular assays of Notch cleavage reveal that this compound is approximately 16-fold selective for the inhibition of APP cleavage. In the human APP-overexpressing Tg2576 transgenic mouse, treatment with this orally active compound results in a robust reduction in brain, plasma, and cerebral spinal fluid Abeta levels, and a reversal of contextual fear-conditioning deficits that are correlated with Abeta load. In healthy human volunteers, oral administration of a single dose of GSI-953 produces dose-dependent changes in plasma Abeta levels, confirming pharmacodynamic activity of GSI-953 in humans." ],

However, the neurotoxicity of the naturally generated Abeta species remains unknown. This study was designed to examine the effects of naturally generated Abeta oligomers, secreted from amyloid precursor protein-expressing cells, on the homeostasis and viability of primary hippocampal neurons. Our results showed that primary hippocampal neurons incubated with condition media containing cell-secreted soluble Abeta had higher levels of heat-shock protein (HSP)27, HSP60 and HSP70, and lower levels of HSP32 than those of the control neurons. The cell-secreted soluble Abeta caused mitochondria dysfunction in hippocampal neurons as demonstrated by depolarized membrane potential and decreased cytochrome c oxidase activity and ATP levels. The levels of pro-apoptotic proteins, Bid, Bax and cytochrome C, were elevated; whereas anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein was reduced in the soluble Abeta-cultured neurons. Apoptosis was also evident in these soluble Abeta-cultured neurons. These results indicate that naturally secreted Abeta induces neuronal injury/death by activating an apoptotic pathway involving impaired mitochondria function and cellular homeostasis." ],

            "Abstract" : [ "Accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is widely believed to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Although amyloid-containing plaques are a key neuropathological feature of AD, soluble forms of Abeta can interfere with synaptic plasticity in the brain, suggesting that this form of the peptide may be responsible for much of the memory deficit seen early in the disease. Here, we investigate the mechanism underlying the effects of Abeta on long-term potentiation (LTP) in area CA1 of rat hippocampus. Extracellular field recordings were made in area CA1 of hippocampal slices taken from young, adult male rats. A non-toxic concentration of Abeta (200 nM) produced a rapid inhibition of LTP induced by 100 Hz stimulation while having no long-term effect on normal synaptic transmission. The same dose of Abeta had no effect on long-term depression (LTD) induced by 1200 pulses at 1 or 3 Hz. Picrotoxin had no effect on the inhibition of LTP, suggesting Abeta does not act by enhancing GABAergic transmission. Since the LTP induction in this study was dependent on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation, we looked at the effect of Abeta on isolated NMDA receptor-mediated field potentials. Abeta produced a small but significant inhibition of NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic potentials ( approximately 25%). However, a low dose of MK-801 (0.5 microM) that produced a similar inhibition of NMDA potentials had no effect on LTP induction but completely blocked LTD induction. These results suggest that Abeta does not inhibit LTP via effects on NMDA receptors, but rather interferes with a downstream pathway." ],

            "Abstract" : [ "Amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta)(1-42) oligomers have recently been discussed as intermediate toxic species in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Here we describe a new and highly stable Abeta(1-42) oligomer species which can easily be prepared in vitro and is present in the brains of patients with AD and Abeta(1-42)-overproducing transgenic mice. Physicochemical characterization reveals a pure, highly water-soluble globular 60-kDa oligomer which we named 'Abeta(1-42) globulomer'. Our data indicate that Abeta(1-42) globulomer is a persistent structural entity formed independently of the fibrillar aggregation pathway. It is a potent antigen in mice and rabbits eliciting generation of Abeta(1-42) globulomer-specific antibodies that do not cross-react with amyloid precursor protein, Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) monomers and Abeta fibrils. Abeta(1-42) globulomer binds specifically to dendritic processes of neurons but not glia in hippocampal cell cultures and completely blocks long-term potentiation in rat hippocampal slices. Our data suggest that Abeta(1-42) globulomer represents a basic pathogenic structural principle also present to a minor extent in previously described oligomer preparations and that its formation is an early pathological event in AD. Selective neutralization of the Abeta globulomer structure epitope is expected to have a high potential for treatment of AD." ],

Recent evidence suggests that Abeta-induced synaptic dysfunction is one of earliest pathogenic events observed in AD. Here we report that synthetic Abeta(1-42) strongly inhibited the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices. To ascertain which Abeta(1-42) sequences contribute to the impairment of LTP, we compared actions of several Abeta fragments and found that the sequence within 25-35 region of Abeta mainly contributes to the expression of LTP impairment. Importantly, we show that insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 significantly inhibit Abeta oligomer formation, particularly dimers and trimers, and ameliorate the synthetic Abeta-induced suppression of LTP. Furthermore, dithiothreitol was found to be capable of significantly preventing the inhibitory effect of insulin on Abeta oligomer formation. In contrast, hemoglobin promotes Abeta oligomer formation and enhances Abeta-mediated inhibition of LTP induction. These results suggest that insulin may have utility in treating the earliest stages of Abeta-induced synaptic dysfunction in AD patients." ],

            "Abstract" : [ "The aggregation of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, as soluble oligomers are intimately linked to neuronal toxicity and inhibition of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). In the C-terminal region of Abeta there are three consecutive GxxxG dimerization motifs, which we could previously demonstrate to play a critical role in the generation of Abeta. Here, we show that glycine 33 (G33) of the central GxxxG interaction motif within the hydrophobic Abeta sequence is important for the aggregation dynamics of the peptide. Abeta peptides with alanine or isoleucine substitutions of G33 displayed an increased propensity to form higher oligomers, which we could attribute to conformational changes. Importantly, the oligomers of G33 variants were much less toxic than Abeta(42) wild type (WT), in vitro and in vivo. Also, whereas Abeta(42) WT is known to inhibit LTP, Abeta(42) G33 variants had lost the potential to inhibit LTP. Our findings reveal that conformational changes induced by G33 substitutions unlink toxicity and oligomerization of Abeta on the molecular level and suggest that G33 is the key amino acid in the toxic activity of Abeta. Thus, a specific toxic conformation of Abeta exists, which represents a promising target for therapeutic interventions." ],

            "Abstract" : [ "Numerous studies have now shown that the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta), the principal component of cerebral plaques in Alzheimer disease, rapidly and potently inhibits certain forms of synaptic plasticity. The amyloid (or Abeta) hypothesis proposes that the continuous disruption of normal synaptic physiology by Abeta contributes to the development of Alzheimer disease. However, there is little consensus about how Abeta mediates this inhibition at the molecular level. Using mouse primary hippocampal neurons, we observed that a brief treatment with cell-derived, soluble, human Abeta disrupted the activation of three kinases (Erk/MAPK, CaMKII, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-activated protein Akt/protein kinase B) that are required for long term potentiation, whereas two other kinases (protein kinase A and protein kinase C) were stimulated normally. An antagonist of the insulin receptor family of tyrosine kinases was found to mimic the pattern of Abeta-mediated kinase inhibition. We then found that soluble Abeta binds to the insulin receptor and interferes with its insulin-induced autophosphorylation. Taken together, these data demonstrate that physiologically relevant levels of naturally secreted Abeta interfere with insulin receptor function in hippocampal neurons and prevent the rapid activation of specific kinases required for long term potentiation." ],

            "Abstract" : [ "Progressive memory loss and deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides throughout cortical regions are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Several studies in mice and rats have shown that overexpression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) or pretreatment with Abeta peptide fragments results in the inhibition of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) as well as impairments in learning and memory of hippocampal-dependent tasks. For these studies we have investigated the effects of the Abeta(25-35) peptide fragment on LTP induced by adenylate cyclase stimulation followed immediately by application of Mg(++)-free aCSF (\"chemLTP\"). Treatment of young adult slices with the Abeta(25-35) peptide had no significant effect on basal synaptic transmission in area CA1, but treatment with the peptide for 20 min before inducing chemLTP with isoproterenol (ISO; 1 microM) or forskolin (FSK;10 microM) + Mg(++)-free aCSF resulted in complete blockade of LTP. In contrast, normal ISO-chemLTP was observed after treatment with the control peptide Abeta(35-25). The ability of the Abeta(25-35) peptide fragment to block this and other forms of synaptic plasticity may help elucidate the mechanisms underlying hippocampal deficits observed in animal models of AD and/or AD individuals." ],

            "Abstract" : [ "AD (Alzheimer's disease) is characterized by a progressive and devastating mental decline that is usually presaged by impairment of a form of memory dependent on medial temporal lobe structures, including the hippocampus. The severity of clinical dementia correlates positively with the cerebral load of the AD-related protein Abeta (amyloid beta), particularly in its soluble form rather than the insoluble fibrillar Abeta found in amyloid plaques. Recent research in animal models of AD has pointed to a potentially important role for rapid disruptive effects of soluble species of Abeta on neural function in causing a relatively selective impairment of memory early in the disease. Our experiments assessing the mechanisms of Abeta inhibition of LTP (long-term potentiation), a correlate of memory-related synaptic plasticity, in the rodent hippocampus showed that low-n oligomers were the soluble Abeta species primarily responsible for the disruption of synaptic plasticity in vivo. Exogenously applied and endogenously generated anti-Abeta antibodies rapidly neutralized and prevented the synaptic plasticity disrupting effects of these very potent Abeta oligomers. This suggests that active or passive immunotherapeutic strategies for early AD should target Abeta oligomers in the brain. The ability of agents that reduce nitrosative/oxidative stress or antagonize stress-activated kinases to prevent Abeta inhibition of LTP in vitro points to a key role of these cellular mechanisms at very early stages in Abeta-induced neuronal dysfunction. A combination of antibody-mediated inactivation of Abeta oligomers and pharmacological prevention of cellular stress mechanisms underlying their synaptic plasticity disrupting effects provides an attractive strategy in the prevention of early AD." ],

Although the fibril form of Abeta is known to have neurotoxicity, it has been shown that not only the fibril form but also the oligomer form of Abeta may be related to the neuropathophysiology of AD, specifically to memory loss. Some studies have demonstrated that low concentrations of the Abeta oligomer impair long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular model for learning and memory, after short exposure times in vivo and in vitro, although little is known about the mechanism involved in Abeta-mediated inhibition of LTP. In this study, we used the patch clamp whole-cell technique in rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons to study more precisely how the Abeta oligomer affects synaptic plasticity. The brief perfusion of slices with a low concentration (1microM) of Abeta(1-42) significantly impaired LTP induction of the excitatory input. The same concentration of Abeta did not affect basal transmission or paired-pulse facilitation. We also demonstrated that neither NMDAR-EPSCs nor the voltage-depended calcium channel (VDCC) currents were affected by the same concentration of Abeta(1-42) as used in the LTP experiments. These data suggest that Abeta mediated impairment of LTP induction is independent of NMDARs or VDCCs." ],

            "Abstract" : [ "The mechanisms underlying the inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP) induction by amyloidbeta-peptide (Abeta) were investigated in the medial perforant path of the rat and mouse dentate gyrus in vitro. Evidence is presented in this study that the Abeta-mediated inhibition of LTP induction involves activation of microglia and production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. In control slices, Abeta strongly inhibited induction of NMDA receptor-dependent (NMDAR-dependent) LTP, although not induction of NMDAR-independent LTP or long-term depression (LTD). The inhibition of NMDAR-dependent LTP was prevented by minocycline, an agent that prevents activation of microglia. The involvement of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was shown by the inability of Abeta to inhibit LTP induction in iNOS knock-out mice and also by the ability of two iNOS inhibitors, aminoguanidine and 1400W, to prevent the Abeta-mediated inhibition of LTP induction. The Abeta-mediated inhibition of LTP induction also was prevented by the superoxide scavenger superoxide dismutase applied together with catalase. Evidence for involvement of superoxide in the action of Abeta on LTP induction was shown by the ability of an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase to prevent the Abeta-mediated inhibition of LTP induction. The study thus provides evidence that the Abeta-mediated inhibition of LTP induction involves an inflammatory-type reaction in which activation of microglia results in the production of nitric oxide and superoxide and thence possibly peroxynitrite, a highly reactive oxidant." ],

            "Abstract" : [ "There is growing evidence that mild cognitive impairment in early AD (Alzheimer's disease) may be due to synaptic dysfunction caused by the accumulation of non-fibrillar, oligomeric Abeta (amyloid beta-peptide), long before widespread synaptic loss and neurodegeneration occurs. Soluble Abeta oligomers can rapidly disrupt synaptic memory mechanisms at extremely low concentrations via stress-activated kinases and oxidative/nitrosative stress mediators. Here, we summarize experiments that investigated whether certain putative receptors for Abeta, the alphav integrin extracellular cell matrix-binding protein and the cytokine TNFalpha (tumour necrosis factor alpha) type-1 death receptor mediate Abeta oligomer-induced inhibition of LTP (long-term potentiation). Ligands that neutralize TNFalpha or genetic knockout of TNF-R1s (type-1 TNFalpha receptors) prevented Abeta-triggered inhibition of LTP in hippocampal slices. Similarly, antibodies to alphav-containing integrins abrogated LTP block by Abeta. Protection against the synaptic plasticity-disruptive effects of soluble Abeta was also achieved using systemically administered small molecules targeting these mechanisms in vivo. Taken together, this research lends support to therapeutic trials of drugs antagonizing synaptic plasticity-disrupting actions of Abeta oligomers in preclinical AD." ],

            "Abstract" : [ "Insulysin (EC. 3.4.22.11) has been implicated in the clearance of beta amyloid peptides through hydrolytic cleavage. To further study the action of insulysin on Abeta peptides recombinant rat insulysin was used. Cleavage of both Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) by the recombinant enzyme was shown to initially occur at the His(13)-His(14), His(14)-Gln(15), and Phe(19)-Phe(20) bonds. This was followed by a slower cleavage at the Lys(28)-Gly(29), Val(18)-Phe(19), and Phe(20)-Ala(21) positions. None of the products appeared to be further metabolized by insulysin. Using a rat cortical cell system, the action of insulysin on Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) was shown to eliminate the neurotoxic effects of these peptides. Insulysin was further shown to prevent the deposition of Abeta(1-40) onto a synthetic amyloid. Taken together these results suggest that the use of insulysin to hydrolyze Abeta peptides represents an alternative gene therapeutic approach to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease." ],

Expression of either IAPP or mPS1 but not wild-type amyloid precursor protein or presenilin-1induced formation of actin stress fibers in SN1 cells, a septal neuronal cell line. Treatment with beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide also caused formation of actin stress fibers in SN1 cells and primary cultured hippocampal neurons. Treatment with a gamma-secretase inhibitor completely blocked formation of actin stress fibers, indicating that overproduction of Abeta peptide induces actin stress fibers. Because activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK)-mitogen-associated protein kinase-associated protein kinase (MAPKAPK)-2-heat-shock protein 27 signaling pathway mediates actin polymerization, we explored whether Abeta peptide activates p38MAPK and MAPKAPK-2. Expression of IAPP or mPS1 induced activation of p38MAPK and MAPKAPK-2. Treatment with a p38MAPK inhibitor completely inhibited formation of actin stress fibers mediated by Abeta peptide, IAPP or mPS1. Moreover, treatment with a gamma-secretase inhibitor completely blocked activation of p38MAPK and MAPKAPK-2. In summary, our data suggest that overproduction of Abeta peptide induces formation of actin stress fibers through activation of the p38MAPK signaling pathway in septal neuronal cells." ],

            "Abstract" : [ "The perforant path projecting from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampal dentate gyrus is a particularly vulnerable target to the early deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides in Alzheimer's brain. The authors previously showed that brief applications of Abeta at subneurotoxic concentrations suppressed the early-phase long-term potentiation (E-LTP) in rat dentate gyrus. The current study further examines the effect of Abeta on the late-phase LTP (L-LTP) in this area. Using multiple high-frequency stimulus trains, a stable L-LTP lasting for at least 3 h was induced in the medial perforant path of rat hippocampal slices. Bath application of Abeta(1-42) (0.2-1.0 microM) during the induction trains attenuated both the initial and late stages of L-LTP. On the other hand, Abeta(1-42) perfusion within the first hour following the induction primarily impaired the late stage of L-LTP, which resembled the action of the protein synthesis inhibitor emetine. Blockade of calcineurin activity with FK506 or cyclosporin A completely prevented Abeta-induced L-LTP deficits. These results suggest that Abeta(1-42) impaired both the induction and maintenance phase of dentate L-LTP through calcineurin-dependent mechanisms. In the concentration range effective for inhibiting L-LTP, Abeta(1-42) also reduced the amplitude of NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents in dentate granule cells via a postsynaptic mechanism. In addition, concurrent applications of Abeta(1-42) with the protein synthesis inhibitor caused no additive reduction of L-LTP, indicating a common mechanism underlying the action of both. Thus, inhibition of NMDA receptor channels and disruption of protein synthesis were two possible mechanisms contributing to Abeta-induced L-LTP impairment." ],

            "Abstract" : [ "The cognitive hallmark of early Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an extraordinary inability to form new memories. For many years, this dementia was attributed to nerve-cell death induced by deposits of fibrillar amyloid beta (Abeta). A newer hypothesis has emerged, however, in which early memory loss is considered a synapse failure caused by soluble Abeta oligomers. Such oligomers rapidly block long-term potentiation, a classic experimental paradigm for synaptic plasticity, and they are strikingly elevated in AD brain tissue and transgenic-mouse AD models. The current work characterizes the manner in which Abeta oligomers attack neurons. Antibodies raised against synthetic oligomers applied to AD brain sections were found to give diffuse stain around neuronal cell bodies, suggestive of a dendritic pattern, whereas soluble brain extracts showed robust AD-dependent reactivity in dot immunoblots. Antigens in unfractionated AD extracts attached with specificity to cultured rat hippocampal neurons, binding within dendritic arbors at discrete puncta. Crude fractionation showed ligand size to be between 10 and 100 kDa. Synthetic Abeta oligomers of the same size gave identical punctate binding, which was highly selective for particular neurons. Image analysis by confocal double-label immunofluorescence established that >90% of the punctate oligomer binding sites colocalized with the synaptic marker PSD-95 (postsynaptic density protein 95). Synaptic binding was accompanied by ectopic induction of Arc, a synaptic immediate-early gene, the overexpression of which has been linked to dysfunctional learning. Results suggest the hypothesis that targeting and functional disruption of particular synapses by Abeta oligomers may provide a molecular basis for the specific loss of memory function in early AD." ],

            "Abstract" : [ "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) is a major constituent of the neuritic plaque found in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients, and a great deal of evidence suggests that the neuronal loss that is associated with the disease is a consequence of the actions of Abeta. In the past few years, it has become apparent that activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mediates some of the effects of Abeta on cultured cells; in particular, the evidence suggests that Abeta-triggered JNK activation leads to cell death. In this study, we investigated the effect of intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta(1-40) on signaling events in the hippocampus and on long term potentiation in Schaffer collateral CA1 pyramidal cell synapses in vivo. We report that Abeta(1-40) induced activation of JNK in CA1 and that this was coupled with expression of the proapoptotic protein, Bax, cytosolic cytochrome c, poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and Fas ligand expression in the hippocampus. These data indicate that Abeta(1-40) inhibited expression of long term potentiation, and this effect was abrogated by administration of the JNK inhibitor peptide, D-JNKI1. In parallel with these findings, we observed that Abeta-induced changes in caspase-3 activation and TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling staining in neuronal cultured cells were inhibited by D-JNKI1. We present evidence suggesting that interleukin (IL)-1beta plays a significant role in mediating the effects of Abeta(1-40) because Abeta(1-40) increased hippocampal IL-1beta and because several effects of Abeta(1-40) were inhibited by the caspase-1 inhibitor Ac-YVAD-CMK. On the basis of our findings, we propose that Abeta-induced changes in hippocampal plasticity are likely to be dependent upon IL-1beta-triggered activation of JNK." ],
