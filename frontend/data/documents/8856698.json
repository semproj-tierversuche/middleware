  "Abstract" : [ "The neuroprotective activity of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in combination with the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist MK-801 was evaluated in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. Oxygen/glucose deprivation produced neuronal damage which was assessed using propidium iodide fluorescence. Treatment with increasing doses of bFGF demonstrated significant neuroprotection that was optimal at 10 ng ml-t. This effect was diminished at higher concentrations. MK-801, at the optimal concentration of 30 microM, demonstrated greater neuroprotective efficacy than bFGF. However, bFGF significantly enhanced the protection conferred by MK-801 alone. These results suggest that neurotrophic factors such as bFGF may augment the neuroprotective effects of NMDA antagonists against ischemic neuronal injury." ],
