  "Abstract" : [ "The purpose of this study was to clarify the in vitro pharmacological profile and the in vivo activity of (3S)-7-chloro-3-[2-((1R)-1-carboxyethoxy)-4-aminomethylphenyl]aminocarbonylmethyl-1,3,4,5-tetrahydrobenz[c,d]indole-2-carboxylic acid hydrochloride (SM-31900). SM-31900 inhibited the binding of [3H]glycine and [3H]5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid, radioligands for the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor glycine-binding site, to rat brain membranes in a competitive manner, with K(i) values of 11+/-2 and 1.0+/-0.1 nM, respectively, and completely prevented the binding of [3H]dizocilpine (MK-801), a radioligand for the NMDA receptor channel site. In cultures of rat cortical neurons, SM-31900 markedly prevented the neuronal cell death induced by transient exposure to glutamate, in a concentration-dependent manner. Its neuroprotective potency was much stronger than those of other glycine-binding site antagonists (4-trans-2-carboxy-5,7-dichloro-4-phenylaminocarbonylamino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline (L-689,560), 5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid, and 7-chlorokynurenic acid). Furthermore, SM-31900 showed anticonvulsant activity when administered systemically, unlike other antagonists. These data indicate that SM-31900 is a systemically active antagonist with high affinity for the NMDA receptor glycine-binding site." ],
