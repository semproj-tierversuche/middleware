  "Abstract" : [ "Neuronal signals in the lateral aspect of the macaque cerebellar cortex were studied during a visually guided reaching task. During the performance of this task, the firing rate of most neurons was significantly modulated when reaching with either the ipsilateral or the contralateral arm. In some of these reach-modulated cells, we found that spike firing was correlated with the direction and speed of the reach. These correlations with motor parameters were present during reaching with either the ipsilateral or the contralateral arm. Based on these observations we suggest that spike firing in the lateral cerebellum was correlated with movement and motor parameters irrespective of the effector limb." ],
