  "Abstract" : [ "Deep prepiriform cortex has an important role in modulating neurotransmission during limbic seizures. We used pharmacologic blockade of non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors to study excitatory circuitry from the deep prepiriform cortex to the hippocampus during global ischemia in rat. NBQX, a potent non-NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist, was microinjected stereotactically into the deep prepiriform cortex before global ischemia for 10 min. Neuronal cell death in the hippocampus was evaluated quantitatively 72 h after ischemia. The NBQX-injected rats had a greater number of surviving cells in CA1 sector of hippocampus than did saline-injected controls or rats that received NBQX injections 1 mm from the target. Thus, excitatory amino acid-mediated circuitry emanating from deep prepiriform cortex modulates ischemic neuronal injury in the hippocampus." ],
