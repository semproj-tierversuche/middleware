  "Abstract" : [ "Recent developments in neural interface systems hold the promise to restore movement in people with paralysis. In search of neural signals for control of neural interface systems, previous studies have investigated primarily single and multiunit activity, as well as low frequency local field potentials (LFPs). In this paper, we investigate the information content about grasping motion of a broad band high frequency LFP (200 Hz - 400 Hz) by classifying discrete grasp aperture states and decoding continuous aperture trajectories. LFPs were recorded via 96-microelectrode arrays in the primary motor cortex (M1) of two monkeys performing free 3-D reaching and grasping towards moving objects. Our results indicate that broad band high frequency LFPs could serve as useful signals for restoring a motor function such as grasp control." ],
