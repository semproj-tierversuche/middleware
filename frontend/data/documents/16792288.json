  "Abstract" : [ "In this paper, intracortical local field potentials (LFPs) and single units were recorded from the motor cortices of monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) while they preformed a standard three-dimensional (3-D) center-out reaching task. During the center-out task, the subjects held their hands at the location of a central target and then reached to one of eight peripheral targets forming the corners of a virtual cube. The spectral amplitudes of the recorded LFPs were calculated, with the high-frequency LFP (HF-LFP) defined as the average spectral amplitude change from baseline from 60 to 200 Hz. A 3-D linear regression across the eight center-out targets revealed that approximately 6% of the beta LFPs (18-26 Hz) and 18% of the HF-LFPs were tuned for velocity (p-value < 0.05), while 10% of the beta LFPs and 15% of the HF-LFPs were tuned for position. These results suggest that a multidegree-of-freedom brain-machine interface is possible using high-frequency LFP recordings in motor cortex." ],
