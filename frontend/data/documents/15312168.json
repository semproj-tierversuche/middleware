  "Abstract" : [ "Polymorphisms in the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene affect the risk of Alzheimer disease and the amount of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) deposited in the brain. The apoE protein reduces Abeta levels in conditioned media from cells in culture, possibly through Abeta clearance mechanisms. To explore this effect, we treated multiple neural and non-neural cell lines for 24 h with apoE at concentrations similar to those found in the cerebrospinal fluid (1-5 microg/mL). The apoE treatment reduced Abeta40 by 60-80% and Abeta42 to a lesser extent (20-30%) in the conditioned media. Surprisingly, apoE treatment resulted in an accumulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP)-C-terminal fragments in cell extracts and a marked reduction of APP intracellular domain-mediated signaling, consistent with diminished gamma-secretase processing of APP. All three isoforms of apoE, E2, E3 and E4, had similar effects on Abeta and APP-C-terminal fragments, and the effects were independent of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family. Apolipoprotein E had minimal effects on Notch cleavage and signaling in cell-based assays. These data suggest that apoE reduces gamma-secretase cleavage of APP, lowering secreted Abeta levels, with stronger effects on Abeta40. The apoE modulation of Abeta production and APP signaling is a potential mechanism affecting Alzheimer disease risk." ],
