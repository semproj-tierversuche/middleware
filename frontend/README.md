# Dependencies and Requirements
`python3` as well as the `flask` and `flask_restful` python packages.
When you have a working `python3` installation, you probably already have the
`pip` package manager installed; otherwise, it might be available via your
OS package manager. Once you have `pip`, you can install these packages by
executing

    pip install --user flask flask_restful

# Usage
To start the app in debug mode (listening to `127.0.0.1:5000`), run

    python apip.py
